# Deep Learning Nanodegree 

**NOTE: Work in progress**

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. 

## Projects I have completed:

### Implementation of neural network

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. By building a neural network from the ground up, I got a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts. I also got to see how to apply these networks to solve a real prediction problem.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
